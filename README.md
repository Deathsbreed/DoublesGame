DoublesGame
===========
A stupid game where you enter in the correct double. This was written for
x86-64 Linux computers in Assembly. Why assembly? Because I want to.

Please look at the source file for instructions or enter the `help` command
when prompted for a double to retrieve the full list of commands.

Compiling
---------
I use a Makefile to compile DoublesGame, so if you meet the requirements
simply run `make` in the root directory of this project, the binary should
be available in a directory called `bin/`.
