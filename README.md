DoublesGame
===========
A stupid game where you enter in the correct double. This was written for
x86-64 Linux computers in Assembly. Why assembly? Because I want to.

Compiling
---------
I use a Makefile to compile DoublesGame, so if you meet the requirements
simply run `make` in the root directory of this project, the binary should
be available in a directory called `bin/`. Please note that it will be
expecting the file `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`.
