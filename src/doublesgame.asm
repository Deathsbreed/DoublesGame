# Description:
#   DoublesGame is a small game where you are given 2^X where X is a number
# that continuously increases (starting from 1). You then have to enter the
# correct answer to the equation in order to continue. There are three
# other responses aside from giving a number answer to the equation, these
# are a `help' command, which displays the two other commands, the `answer'
# command which will allow you to skip a double giving you the correct
# answer, and the `exit' command which will close the game.
